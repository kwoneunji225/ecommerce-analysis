## DATA-DRIVEN PERSPECTIVE
## 1. SALES TREND ANALYSIS
Let's look at the big picture and understand the cycle of the sales trend, then dive deeper into the dimensions affecting this trend.

### 1) Overall Sales Trend

- Overall, ConnecTech had successful sales records during 2020–2021.
- In December 2020, sales performance reached its highest point but started to decline in 2022.
- This trend is likely related to the pandemic, as the company experienced increased demand like the rest of the e-commerce industry.
- In October 2022, sales hit their lowest point, indicating that further in-depth analysis is necessary.


### 2) Yearly Trends

The overall trend shows fast growth in 2020, followed by a slow return to normal and a sharp drop in 2022. An increase in order count in 2021, despite declines in total sales and Average Order Value (AOV), suggests a shift in customer purchasing behavior. 

- **Change in Product Mix**: The increase in order count could indicate higher sales of lower-priced items, which would drive down AOV while increasing the number of transactions.
- **Retention of Existing Customers**: While the total sales dropped, the higher order count suggests the company retained or attracted a steady base of customers who engaged with smaller purchases.
- **Market Conditions**: Post-pandemic, consumer spending are likely normalized. Customers may have spent less on each purchase, leading to a lower average order value (AOV), even though they placed more orders overall.
